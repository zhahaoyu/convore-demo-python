# Convore Python Repository

This repository contains several packages for interacting with the Convore API in Python.

## Packages

- `convore_api_client`: A Python client for the Convore API. It is responsible for making low-level API calls.
- `convore_sdk`: A Python SDK for the Convore API. It builds upon the `convore_api_client` to provide higher-level abstractions for easier interaction with the API.
- `demo`: A demo application showcasing the usage of the `convore_sdk` to interact with the Convore API.

## Getting Started

### Running the Demo

To run the demo application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `demo` folder:

   ```bash
   cd demo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using Poetry:

   poetry install
   ```
3. Run the demo scripts
