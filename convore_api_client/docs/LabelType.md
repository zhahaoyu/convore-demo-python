# LabelType

The type of the label, which determines its scope and usage. 'SHARED' labels are accessible across multiple channels, while 'CHANNEL_PRIVATE' labels are restricted to a specific channel. Note: When a 'SHARED' label is created and later applied to a conversation, the API automatically applies the corresponding 'CHANNEL_PRIVATE' label to the conversation in the specific channel, and vice versa.
